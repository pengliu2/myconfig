A post from Internet says you're recruiting, so I'm writing to you to introduce myself and express my interest in working in your group. Hoping there is still spare headcount. Here's a brief of my background.

I graduated from the University of Sciences and Technology of China with a Bachelor degree in Automation and a Master degree in Safety Engineering. And then I worked as a software developer in the mobile device industry for more than six years, now in Motorola China. I'm seeking a chance of advanced education because I believe I'm of the kind of people who fit the research tasks.

It'll be a long time to accomplish the Ph.D program and it's hard to keep the one's passion, while my career experience let me know what I want, how to motivate myself and how to get things done. On the other hand, admittedly, I left school years ago so more efforts will be required if I go back to research work. Those make me different from recent graduates. While, I know exactly what I want in the next several years is to learn about research methodologies in real projects and make my own contribution. These are so important for my future career that I have to be succeeding in this shift. Failure is too expensive so I'll do my best.

Thank you for your attention. I would appreciate it if you review my materials and decide if I'm qualified for the position. Please find the supporting documents enclosed. I've also sent them via the on-line applying system.
