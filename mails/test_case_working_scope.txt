In enclosed CR resolving plan, there is something confused about
estimated effort for LIBkk96330. I'll explain here.

Some missing test cases are listed in the CR, but there are still not
listed here. Team uncovered that more test cases shall be updated
or/and added for new data logger. So team plans to submit a new CR on
test case complementarity to do so, which will cover the requirement
of LIBkk96330, but not do that yet. Here's the working scope of test
case complementarity.

1. To inspect draft test case, estimated 10 staff days for 120
cases. UDC engineers implemented re-design of AP logger. They drafted
some test cases for new AP logger, though those cases is not inspected
and not went into vob yet. Some extra effort can be spent to update
code if necessary.

2. To complement missing cases, estimated 35 staff days for 30
cases. There are few cases listed in 22662_feature_test.xls
implemented in draft test code. Those in blue have to be implemented
as automated cases.  Test cases locate in
/vobs/jem/test/linuxos/datalogger and
/vobs/jem/test/linuxos/drivers/datalogger/ap_test.c have to be updated
for new data logger. The effort will be include in this 30 staff days.

3. To update cases for libaplog, estimated 15 staff days for 79
cases. The cases is manul case currently, though team plan to make
them automated.

4. To update cases for TCMD, estimated 5 staff days for 4 cases. TCMD
command set is udpated after re-design. There will be

5. 10 staff days for test cases for MMC logging. LIBmm59467 is logged
for the change, but the requiement is not clear to data logger team
now. Team will contact submitter to collect requirement. The estimated
effort is 10 staff days according to assumption.

We spent 5 staff days on test case task so remained will be 60 staff
days.

Welcome your comments.
