mail from an applicant 

Mr. Xu, 

Thank you for your attention to my mail. From a post in http://bbs.newsmth.net I got to know you're recruiting Ph.D students, and the post said it's acceptable to write to you directly, so I'm writing to you to introduce myself and express my interests in studying in TTIC. If you've got the position filled, or you don't think I'm qualified for the program, please forgive me for disturbing you. 

I graduated from the Department of Automation of USTC. Now I'm working as a software engineer in Motorola, China. Although I'm doing good at work, 

My resume is attached for your reference. Please feel free to ask me for any other document you think necessary. I'm looking forward to hearing from you.
