Hubble's observations in 1923-1924 with the Hooker Telescope
established beyond doubt that the fuzzy "nebulae" seen earlier with
less sensitive telescopes were not part of our galaxy, as had been
thought, but were galaxies themselves, outside the Milky Way.

In 1929 Hubble and Humason formulated the empirical Redshift Distance
Law of galaxies, nowadays termed simply Hubble's law, which, if the
redshift is interpreted as a measure of recession speed, is consistent
with the solutions of Einstein¡¯s equations of general relativity for
a homogeneous, isotropic expanding space.
