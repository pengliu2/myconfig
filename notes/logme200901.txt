* 2009/01/02 13:53:54 remote gdb for shared lib

In /proc/[pic]/maps, memory location of shared library can be
found. An then, get the offset of .text in this memory location using
objdump. Finally, in gdb, add-symbol-file libshared.so
the-sum-of-above-offsets.

--Bill Gatliff 

parameters:

regs: struct pt_regs *

fsr: an error code that indicates the reason for the page fault

addr: the address that generates the page fault

* 2009/01/05 12:05:01 pte_*() flush_tlb_*() update_mmu_cache()

Linux's page fault handler uses the kernel's memory management
hardware API to manipulate page directories and page tables. Most of
these functions begin with the name pte_*()

When a page table entry structure is configured, it must be written to
the MMU in order for its settings to take effect. The functions that
do this are named flush_tbl_*(). The TLB in the name stands for
Translation Lookaside Buffer, the traditional name used for an MMU's
internal memory mapping registers.

The update_mm_cache() adjusts MMU hardware in response to a page table
entry adjustment performed by the pte_*() and flush_tlb_*()

* 2009/01/07 11:56:12 elf core format

elf-format core files are described by a standard ELF exec header and
a series of ELF program headers. Each one describes a range of the
virtual address space of the process.

* 2009/01/07 15:37:08 kerntypes

kerntypes.c is a dummy module that includes headers for all kernel
types of interest. The kernel type information is used by the lcrash
utility when analyzing system crash dumps or the live system. Using
the type information from the running system, rather than kernel
header files, makes for a more flexible and robust analysis tool.

The kerntypes is in stabs format, generated with -gstabs flag when
compiled.
