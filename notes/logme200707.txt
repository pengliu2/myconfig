*2007/07/03 15:54:07 LogFS

There are two LogFS's. One which focus on snapshot is created by
padala as a part of google summer of code program, and we'll call it
lfs. The other is a scalable flash filesystem.

For the second one, there are two patches for 2.6.21 to support
LogFS. I saved them as logfs.patch.577 and I_LOCK.patch.2.

** Structure of LogFS

LogFS maintains an inode file in media. Each time a file is modified,
Only inode of the file and inode file need to be changed.

*2007/07/14 16:15:49 LogFS super.c

In logfs_get_sb, when device name is not an mtd, logfs_get_sb_bdev is
invoked. The main flow is following logfs_get_sb_device.

logfs_super stores device operations in s_devops field. It is
mtd_devops for mtd device, while bd_devops for block device.

logfs_super_operations is defined in inode.c.

logfs_disk_super is on-medium superblock which is defined in
include/linux/logfs.h



*2007/07/16 22:51:06 LogFS inode file

inodes will be stored in a inode file. The inode of inode file cannot
be written to the inode file, so it is stored in the journal instead. 

More explanation is declaimed in inode.c.
