* compiling PCK from the source

Firstly, you must get all the permission to access directories
needed.

And then, create a dynamic view for VOB of the code.

Now you can find the source code in /proj/pck_tag.

Copy the directory source into your local directory (for example,
/home/acode).

Start Eclipse, which locates in /home/share/tools/eclipse.

Create a java project from existing source, and fill the source/gui in
the column "Directory".

If you do follow above steps, you can open the file
integrationtool.product. Eclipse parses the file, and lists what you
can do with this product. 

You can choose to Testing->Launch the project. To get a release
package, click Exporting->Eclipse Product export wizard.

Choose a proper directory to export your product into and click
finish. You can run itool after Eclipse accomplishes the exporting.

All above actions are made in RHEL 200.121.9.45.

* PCK accessing repository via ftp

Create a new project from a configuration, which I have put into the dir /home/configfiles/.

Allocate your project, giving it would be in dir myproj, and modify apt/etc/sources.list.d/sources.list with your favourite text editor.

The sources list line by lien. Each line is composed of "rpm [location of souce] [arch] [release version]".

Write your source URL which is a ftp site. You must make sure the repository is existing.

Note: Configuration file, with suffix xml, will be used only once during create the project. So we need only care files in project directory.

* Standalone Help

In windows platform, a command line can start standalone help system of eclipse.

java -classpath c:\eclipse\plugins\org.eclipse.help.base_3.1.0.jar org.eclipse.help.standalone.Help -command displayHelp

But linux complains eclipsehome is incorrectly set.

When you are access the Eclipse help system, you are actually starting up an embedded Apache Tomcat server.

Content can be searched thanking to the Apache Lucene search engine.

* Call Help from Java

I added a bookmark for Installing Standaline Help.

One thing should be taked care of. That is Help System not only depend on org.eclipse.help.base but also those listed in section [Optional]Installing a minimal set of plug-ins.

* Means for Detecting Controls getting/losting focus, selecting/unselecting

Controls can add a SelectionListener and a FocusListener witch will handle selecting and getting/losting focus. The machenism just like QT.
