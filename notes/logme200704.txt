** process management

QNX process manager does not reside in QNX microkernel. Process
manager is the only process to share the same address as the
microkernel. Process manager is responses for the creation of
processes and management of process resource.

The scheduling of processes is managed by the QNX microkernel
scheduler.

** Skills of reading

- Scan the passage to find and highlight key facts (dates, numbers,
  terms) and information

- Increase vocabulary knowledge, perhaps by using flashcards

- Rather then carefully reading each word and each sentence, practice
  skimming a passage quickly to get a general impression of the main
  idea.

- Choose some unfamiliar words in the passage and guess the meaning
  from the context (surrounding sentences).

- Select all pronouns (he, him, they, them, etc) and identify which
  nouns each one refers to in the passage.

- Practice making inferences and drawing conclusions based on what is
  implied in the passage as a whole.

** New Test Format

- Reading 3-5 passages, 12-14 questions each, 60-100 minutes

- Listening 4-6 lectures, 6 questions each, 2-3 conversations, 5
  questions each, 60-90 minutes

- Speaking 6 tasks, 2 independent and 4 integrated, 20 minutes

- Writing 1 integrated task, 20 minutes, 1 independent task, 30
  minutes

** Software interface

*** Reading Passages

- You must scroll to the end of each passage before receiving
  questions on that passage.

*** Listening Section

- Academic lectures include lecture where the professor is the only
  speaker and that where the professor and students will speak.

- One new multiple-choice question type measures understanding of a
  speaker's attitude, degree of certainty, or purpose. These questions
  require you to listen for voice tones and other cues and determine
  how speekers feel about the topic being discussed.

** form

Two questions are independent speaking tasks. Four are integrated
speaking tasks. In integrated tasks, you will listen to a conversation
or to an excerpt from a lecture, or read a passage and then listen to
a brief discussion or lecture excerpt, before you are asked the
question.

The Speaking section takes approximately 20 minutes. Respond time
allowed for each question ranges from 45 to 60 seconds.

Question 1: 15 seconds 45 seconds
Question 2: 15 seconds 45 seconds

Question 3: 30 seconds 60 seconds
Question 4: 30 seconds 60 seconds
Question 5: 20 seconds 60 seconds
Question 6: 20 seconds 60 seconds

*2007/04/19 16:17:25 SCM interface

** Build Request
    Interface: PL
- PL notices SCM the build plan by email one week in advance. (Just
    approximate date, let's SCM arrange time.)

Good!
- PL sends build request to SCM by email when all needed code and
    review finished. Refer to build request template attached.

CR engineer should send the CR number to SCM when code review is
    finished. SCM will merge 

- If just want to merge code, write "N/A" in "Purpose" and "Version"
    term in the build request.

There shall be no standaline merge request. One has to base his/her
change on other's change, he/she should 

-SCM replies the build request and gives an estimated time when build
 can be finished.

SCM shall follow build plan to make build. PL shall send build plan
if there is update. By this way, SCM can arrange build
ahead. Following strict process will cost more effort to make plan,
but it will improve quality.

- When the build finished, SCM replies the build request again with
    label type and location.



Release Request
    Interface: PL

- PL notices SCM the release plan one week in advance. (Just
    approximate date, let's SCM arrange time)

- PL sends release request to SCM by email which includes the last
  label type, deadline and release notes draft.

- SCM replies the release request and give an estimated time when it
  can be finished.

- When the release finished, SCM replies the release request again.

Baseline Document Request
    Interface: Review meeting leader or author (if it do not need to
    be reviewed)

- Review meeting leader sends document as accessories after verifies
  the document and closes the meeting in WISE.

- SCM replies it when baselined the document.

Note:
Carbon Copy all emails to team members.
The document always can not be verified in time, the actual baseline date may be several dates after author has sent out. If author sends the baseline request to SCM directly, SCM easy to forget to baseline it when she takes over more than one team's SCM task. So we plan review leader as interface.
CR/PR and branch type will be applied by team members right along. Geng Yanyu will discuss this issue with TG SCM team.

** effective changes for users

- Floating point performance, with or without an FPU is very much
  faster, and mixing soft and hardfloat code is possible

- structure packing is not as painful as it used to be

- more compatibility with various tools

- a more efficient syscall convention

- at present it works with ARMv4t, ARMv5t processors and above, but
  supporting ARMv4 requires modification to GCC
