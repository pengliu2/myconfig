    Motorola
    ==============================================================================================================
        • In C,  Python,   Perl  and   Java,   developing    smart   phone   features  and   development     tools.
          Leading   the  team   in some   projects.

    Software   Engineer                                                                    Aug  2003  - Jan   2006
    Pollex Mobile   Software    Co., Beijing,  China
    ==============================================================================================================
        • Developed    major  parts  of Hopen   Operating    System    3.0, a proprietary  RTOS.   Ported   Hopen
          OS  to diﬀerent   CPUs,    including   Intel XScale   PXA270     and  IBM  PowerPC     405.

    Research   Assistant                                                                    Sep  2000  - Jul  2003
    State  Key  Lab  of Fire  Science,  Hefei,  China
    ==============================================================================================================
        • Participated   in  the research   project,  the  application   of Ethernet   in real-time  control   sys-
          tem.  As  a  programmer,     participated    in the  project  to construct  a ceramics   manufacture
          control  system,   designed   and  implemented     a CAN    ﬁeld  bus  interface circuit board   and  its
          WDM    driver.

ACHIEVEMENTS
    Tools and  methods    for energy    usage  analysis   on ARM    Linux                    <C on  ARM    Linux>
    Role: Owner                                                                <Python   and  C++  on  Windows>
    ==============================================================================================================
    This  played  a key  role in the  development     of latest ﬂagship    products.  Following   jobs have   been
    done  to build  up  a  set of systematic    methods    to keep   track  of energy   usage,  to point   out the
    violator and  to  optimize   battery  performance.
        • Complemented       Linux   kernel  2.6.35  with   support   for tracing  OMAP4     power  events.    The
          upstream    Linux   kernel   of this version   doesn’t  support    tracing these  for ARM,    so  I back
          ported  it. With   this ported,   CPU   frequency    adjustments,    CPU   hotplug   events,  CPU    idle
          state changes    and  all other   power   related  events   can  be logged.  Logging   can  be   turn on
          and  oﬀ  without   phone   reboot,  and  its overhead   is low.
        • Implemented      a current   drain  measurement      tool.  It formalized   and  automated     the  mea-
          surement.     The  objectives   now   include  idle  mode   current   drain, audio   playback    current
          drain,  video  playback   current   drain,  etc, and  can  be deﬁned    by the developers.
        • Created   a  set of tools to  analyze   traces.  The  amount    of logs  can be  huge,  so I developed
          helper  applications    to  accelerate   the  analysis,   for instance,   the  tool to analyze    Linux
          kernel  logs  and  user  space   logs  together,  the  tool to visualize  CPU   idle  mode   switching,
          and  the  tool to create  stats  for wake-ups    events.
        • Discovered    several   reliable  methods    to  analyze   the  logs.  These  methods    use   the  logs,
          the tools  and  the  knowledge     on  Linux   to guide  the  system   optimization   from   the  power
          management      point  of view.

     ============================================================================================================
     This  is the  Motorola’s   unique  solution  to capture   logs for Android  phones,  covering   from  Linux
     kernel  to  applications.
         • Designed     and  implemented    a  method   to capture   the snapshot  of system   before  watchdog
           reset  issues.  This  helped  BSP   team   ﬁx complicated    issues leading to watchdog    reset. The
           implementation       included  deeply   hacking   into  ARM   Monitor  mode    code, bootloader   and
           Linux    kernel.
         • Application     Processor  logger.  It serializes  Android   logs and Linux   kernel  messages   onto
           non-volatile    memory.   It has  become    one  of the most  important   tool to undertake   oﬀ-line
           analysis.
         • Ported   driver   and  parsing  tool for ARM    CoreSight   Trace  Macrocells   to accelerate  debug-
           ging   low  level software  issues.
         • Helper    tools, such  as log merge   script and   visualizing  script.

     Hopen    OS  has   been  successfully  deployed    on more   than  10  products  of leading  mobile  device
     vendors.    It was  also  certiﬁcated  as  one  of best  innovative  products  by  Beijing  Municipal   Sci-
     ence  and   Technology     Committee.    My   job  was  developing   major  parts,  porting  it to deferent
     hardware.
