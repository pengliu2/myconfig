Occupation
===============
--Motorola Software Group China, from Feb 2006 to present.
Title: Senior Software Engineer
Duty: to lead a team focusing on software component packaging,
  integration, distribution.
Highlights:

*Platform Creating Kit
Basing on apt-rpm utilities, provide phone developer with eclipse RCP
application, which make RootFS or development environment management
straight forward.

--Software Engineer in Beijing Hopen Software Engineering Co. Ltd. and
  Beijing Pollex Mobile Software Co., Ltd, from Aug 2003 to Jan 2006
Title: Senior Software Engineer
Duty: to port HOPEN3.0 OS to develop board, and to develop device
  drivers.
Highlights:

*QT-based navigation/communication platform
Leading a group with three developers, I implemented a GPS navigating
system, which also have abilities of communicating via wireless
module, hand-writing recognition.

*Solution for PC dialup through GPRS Phone
By cooperation between PC WDM driver and softwares of phone, PC can be
  connected to internet. Designed and implemented by myself.

*Solution for Power Management
Adaptation was made on HOPEN3.0 for Intel Xscal power management
mechanism. Some device drivers as flash and usb driver were partly
rewriten. It was applied in products.

*Bootloader and HOPEN3.0 OS Porting
HOPEN3.0 OS and hopen bootloader were porting to two develop board by
myself, as well as a few device drivers for LCD controller, codec and
so on.

*Run-time loading API
Designed and implemented by myself. Applications were provided with a
set of APIs for loading executable data onto appointed address, so
single procedure application can do run-time load. 

*Smart Panel LCD driver
Designed and implement driver for LCD with internal framebuffer. The
smart panel LCD was first time supported by Intel xscale. 

--Software Engineer in Beijing Hopen Software Engineering Co. Ltd.,
Title: Software Engineer
Duty: to design and realize device drivers for HOPEN3.0 OS, and
  to measure and optimize performance for various Hardware Platform.

Highlights:
*Porting HOPEN3.0 OS to PPC405
Hardware Abstract Layer(system initializing, interrupt service, memory
management and so on) was modified to make HOPEN3.0 run on IBM PPC405
based board.

*Phone as mobile storage
The usb storage requests were parsed by phone, and be satisfied with
an appropriate reading or writing action. Usb client driver was
modified to get an ideal speed.

*DiskOnChip driver for HOPEN3.0
By myself, ported Linux MTD driver and Block Device driver for
DiskOnChip to HOPEN3.0, a real-time embedded OS developed by Hopen,
and built a demo system based on MX1ADS, where HOPEN3.0 can be booted
from DOC and work without any other Flash Device.

*Performance Measurement and Optimization for HOPEN3.0 Interrupt
 Processing on ARM Evaluater7t
With signal generator and oscillograph, I measured the HOPEN3.0's
interrupt service delay on ARM Evaluater7t, and rewriten interrupt
service routines to cut down delay.

*Visual Serial Port on USB driver for Windows2K
By myself, designed and implemented a WDM(Windows Device Model) driver
for Windows2K, which establishs visual serial port(s) on USB
connection. Cooperating with driver on target board, it makes
applications based on Serial Port usable on platform without serial
connection.

Research Experience
===================
My project for master degree was to develop a hardware and software
system, which enabled every two terminals of it communicate with each
other, such as the transmission of video and audio data. ARMLinux was
ported as the operating systems, on the circuit board based on Intel
StrongARM SA-1110 Micro-controllers. I was in charge of maintaining
the software development environment, organizing the software
development part and undertaking the transplantation of the system,
transplantation of JTAG tools and Bootloader, some device drivers and
a demo application for the platform which exchange multimedia and
digital data through socket.
