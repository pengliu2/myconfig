\section{CAREER HISTORY}
	\uline{{\sl Senior Software Engineer}} \hfill \uline{Feb 2006 - Present}\\
        \uline{Motorola}
	\begin{itemize}
        \item In C, Python, Perl and Java, developing smart phone features and development tools. Leading the team in some projects.
	\end{itemize}

        \uline{{\sl Software Engineer}} \hfill                  \uline{Aug 2003 - Jan 2006}\\
        \uline{Pollex Mobile Software Co., Beijing, China}
	\begin{itemize}
        \item Developed major parts of Hopen Operating System 3.0, a proprietary RTOS. Ported Hopen OS to different CPUs, including Intel XScale PXA270 and IBM PowerPC 405. 
	\end{itemize}

        \uline{{\sl Research Assistant}} \hfill                 \uline{Sep 2000 - Jul 2003}\\
        \uline{State Key Lab of Fire Science, Hefei, China}
        \begin{itemize}
        \item Participated in the research project, the application of Ethernet in real-time
        control system. As a programmer, participated in the project to construct a ceramics
        manufacture control system, designed and implemented a CAN field bus interface
        circuit board and its WDM driver.
	\end{itemize}

\section{ACHIEVEMENTS}

\uline{{\sl Tools and methods for energy usage analysis on ARM Linux }} \hfill \uline{C on ARM Linux}\\
\uline{Role: Owner} \hfill \uline{Python and C++ on Windows}

This played a key role in the development of latest flagship products. Following jobs have been done to build up a set of systematic methods to keep track of energy usage, to point out the violator and to optimize battery performance.

\begin{itemize}
\item Complemented Linux kernel 2.6.35 with support for tracing OMAP4 power events. The upstream Linux kernel of this version doesn't support tracing these for ARM, so I back ported it. With this ported, CPU frequency adjustments, CPU hotplug events, CPU idle state changes and all other power related events can be logged. Logging can be turn on and off without phone reboot, and its overhead is low.
\item Implemented a current drain measurement tool. It formalized and automated the measurement. The objectives now include idle mode current drain, audio playback current drain, video playback current drain, etc, and can be defined by the developers. 
\item Created a set of tools to analyze traces. The amount of logs can be huge, so I developed helper applications to accelerate the analysis, for instance, the tool to analyze Linux kernel logs and user space logs together, the tool to visualize CPU idle mode switching, and the tool to create stats for wake-ups events. 
\item Discovered several reliable methods to analyze the logs. These methods use the logs, the tools and the knowledge on Linux to guide the system optimization from the power management point of view.
\end{itemize}

\uline{{\sl Debug infrastructure}} \hfill \uline{C/Assembly Language on ARM Linux} \\
\uline{Role: Leader}

This is the Motorola's unique solution to capture logs for Android phones, covering from Linux kernel to applications.

	\begin{itemize}
	\item Designed and implemented a method to capture the snapshot of system before watchdog reset issues. This helped BSP team fix complicated issues leading to watchdog reset. The implementation included deeply hacking into ARM Monitor mode code, bootloader and Linux kernel.
	\item Application Processor logger. It serializes Android logs and Linux kernel messages onto non-volatile memory. It has become one of the most important tool to undertake off-line analysis.
	\item Ported driver and parsing tool for ARM CoreSight Trace Macrocells to accelerate debugging low level software issues.
	\item Helper tools, such as log merge script and visualizing script.
	\end{itemize}

\uline{{\sl Hopen real-time OS }} \hfill \uline{C/Assembly Language on ARM Linux}\\
\uline{Role: Key Developer}

Hopen OS has been successfully deployed on more than 10 products of leading mobile device vendors. It was also certificated as one of best innovative products by Beijing Municipal Science and Technology Committee. My job was developing major parts, porting it to deferent hardware.

\uline{{\sl PCK, a package management system for embedded system development.}} \hfill \uline{Jave on Eclipse}\\
\uline{Role: Leader}

It has been used in iDEN product line by over 400 developers. Functionality includesed development environment setting-up, system assembling, image generating and signature generating.
