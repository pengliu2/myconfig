    Tools: C on  ARM   Linux, Python    and  C++  on  Windows
    This played   a key  role in the  development    of latest  ﬂagship   products.  Following   jobs  have  been
    done  to build  up  a systematic   method   to keep   track  of energy   usage, point  out  the violator  and
    optimize   battery  performance.
        • Complement      2.6.35  Linux  kernel   with  support   for tracing  OMAP4     power   events.
        • Implemented      a current   drain measurement       tool. It formalized   and   automated    the mea-
          surement.
        • Created   a  reliable method   to analyze   traces.

          implementation      included   deeply  hacking    into ARM     Monitor   mode   code,  bootloader   and
          Linux   kernel.
        • Application    Processor   logger. It serializes  Android    logs and  Linux   kernel  messages    onto
          non-volatile   memory.    It has  become   one  of the  most   important   tool to undertake    oﬀ-line
          analysis.
        • Ported   driver  and  parsing  tool for  ARM    CoreSight    Trace  Macrocells   to accelerate  debug-
          ging  low  level software   issues.
