In some countries, people are no longer allowed to smoke in many
public places and office buildings. Do you think this is a good rule
or a bad rule?

Response:

Smoking can bring many disadvantages to environment, health, safety,
so it's definitely a good advantage to ban smoking in public places
such as office buildings, schools, schools.

It's a well known and accepted view that smoking dramatically harms
health, not only of the smokers, but also those who breath second-hand
smoke. Medical studies show that smokers, comparing with who don't
smoke at all, are more likely to suffer cancer, lung disease. In
addition, the harm of smoking does not only threaten the smokers
themselves, but also those nearby. One study shows that secondhand
smoking is even more halmful than the effect of smoking by oneself. So
in the families with infant or pregnant woman smoking shall be
restrictly forbidened.
