The most important function of advertisement is to impress audience or
viewer with advantages of the product which is marketing. So I agree
that most of advertisements tend to make the products seem a little better than
what it really is. But It's not reasonable to state that the
amplification is too extreme to be acceptable. In the meantime, as customers, we
have to train ourselves to identify the actual value of advertised
products.

We cannot expect an advertisement descrbie the product
objectively. Most of advertisement emphasize the advantage of the
product, and bypass the shortage when it's profiling the
product. Definitely, the ignorance makes the product looks better than
what it actually is. For instance, the advertisement for a new model
of basketball shoe may tell us a lot on the comfortability and looks,
but we may find that the shoes are expensive and tending to became
dirty. 

Another kind of cases may seem like that the advertisement delivers us
the expression implicitly. When you see Micheal Jordan flying with
Nike shoes, you may get such an expression that you can play as well
as Jordan if you wear the same shoes as that he wears. While, the
fact, in the baseketball shoes case, is that Jordan practises for more
than 6 hours a day and plays in not less than 100 games per year, and
the practice and giant number of games make Jordan to become a greate
player, while his shoes helped not so much.

Finally, the advertisement can mislead us even if it exaggerates the
product no so much. We'll waste time to drive to shop and and find the
product is not suitable for us. Or we even may waste money if we don't
find the disadvantage of the product until we use it several times. So
I suggest that we shall search comments for the product in
advertisement before we decide to buy it.
