The lecture opposes the opinion of reading that Anasazi moved away from Chaco Canyon because of a severe summer drought.

The first evidence mentioned by the reading is that the time when Anasazi abandoned their village is the same as the beginning of a sixty-year summer drought. To contrary the point, the lecture uses another study result that a lot of tree in Chaco Canyon survived the drought so the drought seemed not affect Chano Canyon so much to compell Anasazi from their home.

The second evidence in the reading is irrigation systems found in Chaco Canyon, which could indicate that Anasazi suffered shortage of water. While the lecture states the systems just illuminate that Anasazi was aware of potential crisis and they had been prepared for the drought. 

The last evidence suggested by the reading is overgrown population caused food shortage so Anasazi fled from their village in a sudden. The lecture state that study unveils that Anasazi had been able to store food for a long time so food shortage may not the root cause. And the fact the Anasazi abruptly fled may be the result of attack of other tribes, disease or overfarming.
