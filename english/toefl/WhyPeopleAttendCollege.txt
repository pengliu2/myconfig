For instance,
applicants with Computer Science degrees would not only be qualified
for jobs in high-tech companies, they would also be well prepared for
any job with computer skills as a prerequisite.

With a larger range of
potential jobs to choose from, degree holders are more likely to find
a job that suits their particular needs and interests.

Even if a job applicant without a college degree has
high standardized test scores, employers may still pay a higher value
on an applicant with similar test scores who also possessed
credentials from a well-known university. 
Because of the extent to
which a college degree is accepted by employers as proof of competence
in a given field, college graduates are not only more likely to
receive more job offers, they can also command higher salaries than
applicants who lack college diplomas.

Finally, in addition to offering more choices and higher salaries, a
college degree offers access to jobs with a clear path towards
professional advancement.

A B.S. in biology, for example, could allow
a student to find a job in a lab after graduation, a first step on the
road towards a career in scientific research.

The same major could
also be used to apply to medical school, and a career as a
doctor.

Both of these avenues would be unavailable without taking the
