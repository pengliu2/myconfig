Topic:
Only through mistakes can there be discovery or progress.

Success gets birth from failure, as a widely spreaded version of "only
through mistakes can there be discovery or progress", are induced even
from our childhood. Peaple, who are teachers of primary school, high
school, professors or your employer, are teaching latercomers day and ay. We can also see it in
the story of IBM president Watson and a vice president. It's ture that
who, like Paul Ehrich, talent scientists, could be encouraged by this credo. But it
cannot bear a close examination.

"Making mistakes", especially connecting to "discovery", dramatically
implies that a human being, who we can reasonably assume he or she is
a scientist, is conducting a experiencism scientific study. But, life
is so short that we must straight to scientific discovery and
progress. 

Another important fact worth noticing is that mistakes are not
free. After a notible amount of mistakes, one may be able to obtain
some kind of progress, nevertheless, can it compensates the cost of
time and resource of those mistakes? If we do not condiser the ratio
of cost and benefit, it is even more harmful to obtain discovery and progress from the
mistakes consuming resource in a unaffordable way.

Furthermore, the statement provides an expression that a successful
result can be reached finally without any analysis and adjust after
each mistake. 

As has been discussed above, we can safely state that it is not
necessary for discovery or progress to make mistake, which shall be
and can be avoided if only analysis and investigation abased on
practice and theory are fully deployed. Although, we shall not be
afraid of making mistakes.
