    Excellent: Besides works summarized in Mid-Year Assessment, I
    took care of panic daemon and other panic handling functionality
    for 2.0 and Android.

1. Now, the initial version of panic daemon for Android has been ready to
be integrated. Because of lack of tcmd and other dependence of panic
daemon, we have also been working to provide a quick solution
for BP team hoping it can help them develop BP in the early phase of
new platform.

2. All the CRs from previous drumbeats have been picked up to
MAGX2.0. It's worth noting that most of them are related to ensure
effective panic logging. Also I worked with team for aplogger
performance improvement and we delivered enhanced version.

3. I analyzed and compared panic handling methods in MAGX and in
Android. The results have been taken as base line in architecture
meeting. 


   Excellent: 
1. Regression test cases taken from LJ have been enabled in MAGX2.0. 
2. Zero defect in panic daemon in MAGX2.0.
3. N/A. Need quality data.
4. Team is strictly following peer review and UT processes. With
quality engineer, we undertook insight analysis onto defect introduced
by LIBqq24098 and defect CR LIBrr23762. Then shared actions with team.
5. I refined the sprint sheets. Now all tasks for panic daemon as well
as most of datalogger task are tracking with SCRUM process.
6. Rules followed well. We submitted the deployment plan to OSS CCB on
libaplog changes.

    Good: 
1. I Kept closely tracking on action items and assigned tasks for
me. All actions and tasks meet the time requests.
2. Panic daemon has been delivered in timely way, with high
quality. I also helped other team members on urgent CRs.
