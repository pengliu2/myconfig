./Makefile:
        to build tcmd_test.c
./aptest.sh:
        Run test cases one by one, from the first one by default. Not
        one to one with 22662_Feature_Test.xls [Need more
        investigation].
./filehog.c:
        Not used. Fork a new process and both father and child run an
        endless loop.
./fill_file.sh:
        fill 1024 times of abcdefghijklmno to /ezxlocal/file
./fill_panic.sh:
        fill 1024 times of abcdefghijklmno to /var/tmp/fill_file_temp
        and then dd the file to /dev/mtdblock/kpanic
./gen_files.sh:
        touch 2521 files in /ezxlocal/app_dump/
./nullptr_prog.c:
        write to null pointer
./stdouterr_test.c:
        continueously writing to stdout and stderr
./touch_lots.sh:
        touch several files in certain directory. number of files,
        base name of files, directory can be customized.
./aplogd/:
        aplogd test suite
./aplogd/Makefile:
        compile input_test and log_parse, package common.sh and
        random_input.sh test_daemon.sh
./aplogd/input_test.c:
        send certain amount of logger with a short interval.
./aplogd/test_daemon.sh:
        another 13 cases, which are more reasonable.
./aplogd/common.sh:
        functions useful.
./aplogd/random_input.sh:
        log randomly, and verify that log file is integrate.

Following files seem developed for LIBkk96330, but not
completed. Where is sudatalog_test source code?
./regression_suite/ap_test.sh:
        more test cases for aplogd than DataLoggerTestPlan.
./regression_suite/pd_test.sh:
        more test cases for panic daemon than DataLoggerTestPlan.
./regression_suite/bp_test.sh:
        more test cases for bplogd.
